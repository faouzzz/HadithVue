O Allah give me faith and certainty after which there is no disbelief, and mercy, by which I may attain the high level of Your generosity in the world and the Hereafter.  O Allah, I ask You for success [in that which You grant, and relief] in the Judgment, and the positions of the martyrs, and the provision of the successful, and aid against the enemies. O Allah, I leave to You my need, and my actions are weak, I am in need of Your mercy, so I ask You, O Decider of the affairs, and O Healer of the chests, as You separate me from the punishment of the blazing flame, and from seeking destruction, and from the trial of the graves. O Allah, whatever my opinion has fallen short of, and my intention has not reached it, and my request has not encompassed it, of good that You have promised to anyone from Your creation, or any good You are going to give to any of Your slaves, then indeed, I seek it from You and I ask You for it, by Your mercy, O Lord of the Worlds. O Allah, Possessor of the strong rope, and the guided affair, I ask You for security of the Day of the Threat, and Paradise on the Day of Immortality along with the witnesses, brought-close, who bow and prostrate, who fulfill the covenants, You are Merciful, Loving, and indeed, You do what You wish. O Allah, make us guided guiders and not misguided misguiders, an ally to Your friends, an enemy to Your enemies. We love due to Your love, those who love You, and hate, due to Your enmity those who oppose You. O Allah, this is the supplication (that we are capable of), and it is upon You to respond, and this is the effort (that we are capable of), and upon You is the reliance.

When he would rise from the two prostrations, he would likewise raise his hands, and say the Takbir, and when he opened his Salat after the Takbir, he would say: “I have directed my face towards the One who has created the heavens and the earth, as a Hanif, and I am not of the idolaters. Indeed, my Salat, my sacrifice, my living, my dying, is for Allah, the Lord of all that exists, without partner, and with this have I been ordered and I am of the Muslims. O Allah, You are the King, there is none worthy of worship except You. Glorified are You, You are My Lord, and I am Your slave, I have wronged myself and I admit to my sin, so forgive me all my sins, verily, there is none who forgives sins but You, and guide me to the best of manners, none guides to the best of them except You, and turn away from me the evil of them, none can turn away from me the evil of them, none turns away from me the evil of them except You, I am here in Your obedience and aiding Your cause, and I am reliant upon You and ever-turning towards You, [and] there is no refuge from You nor hiding place from You except (going) to You, I seek Your forgiveness, and I repent to you (Wajjahtu Wajhi Lilladhi Fataras-Samawati Wal-Arda Hanifan Wa Ma Ana Min Al-Mushrikin, Inna Salati Wa Nusuki Wa Mahyaya Wa Mamati Lillahi Rabbil-Alamin, La Sharika Lahu Wa Bidhalika Umirtu Wa Ana Min Al-Muslimin. Allahumma Antal-Maliku La Ilaha Illa Anta Subhanaka, Anta Rabbi, Wa Ana Abduka Zalamtu Nafsi Wa’taraftu Bidhanbi Faghfirli Dhanbi Jami’an, Innahu La Yaghfir udh-Dhunuba Illa Ant.

Labaika Wa Sa’daika Wa Ana Bika Wa Ilaika, [Wa] La Manja Minka Wa La Milja Illa Ilaik, Astaghfiruka Wa Atubu Ilaik).” Then he would recite, then when he would bow, his speech in his Ruku, would be to say: “O Allah, to You have I bowed, and in You have I believed, and to You have I submitted (in Islam), and You are my Lord. My hearing, my sight, my brain and my bones are humbled to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds all that exists (Allahumma Laka Raka’tu Wa Bika Amantu Wa Laka Aslamtu Wa Anta Rabbi, Khasha’a Sam’I Wa Basari Wa Mukhkhi Wa Azmi Lillahi, Rabbil-Alamin).” Then, when he raised his head from Ruku he would say: “Allah hears the one who praises him (Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah).” Then he would follow it with: “O Allah, our Lord, to You is praise filling the heavens and the earth and filling whatever You wish of things afterward (Allahumma Rabban Lakal-Hamdu Mil’as-Samawati Wal-Ardi Wa Mil’a Ma Shi’ta Min Shai’in Ba’d).” Then, when he would prostrated he would say in his prostration: “O Allah, to You have I prostrated, and in You have I believed, and to You have I submitted (in Islam), and You are my Lord, my face has prostrated to the One that created it, and grated its hearing and sight, Blessed is Allah, the Best of Creators (Allahumma Laka Sajadtu Wa Bika Amantu Wa Laka Aslamtu, Wa Anta Rabbi, Sajada WAjhi Lilladhi Khalaqahu Wa Shaqqa Sam’ahu Wa Basarahu, Tabarak Allahu Ahsanul-Khaliqin).” When he was finished with his Salat, we would say: “O Allah, forgive me what I have done, before and after, and what I have hidden, and what I have done openly, and You are my Deity, there is none worthy of worship except You (Allahummaghfirli Ma Qaddamtu Wa Ma Akhkhartu Wa Ma Asrartu Wa Ma A’lantu, Wa Anta Ilahi, La Ilaha Illa Ant).”</b>",

This Quran has suddenly left my heart, and I do not find myself capable of it.’ So the Messenger of Allah (A) said to him: ‘O Abul-Hasan! Should I not teach you words that Allah shall benefit you with, and benefit whomever you teach, and they will make whatever you have learned in your chest firm?’ He said: ‘Of course, O Messenger of Allah (S), so teach me.’ He said: ‘When it is the night of (before) Friday, then if you are able to stand in the last third of the night, then verily it is a witnessed hour, and supplication is answered in it. And my brother Ya’qub (AS) did say to his sons: I shall seek forgiveness for you from my Lord. He said: “Until the night of Friday comes.” So if you are not able, then stand in the middle of it, and if you are not able then stand in the first of it. And pray four Rak’ah. Recite  Fatihatul-Kitab (the Opening of the Book) and Surat Ya-Sin in the first Rakah, and Fatihatul-Kitab and Ha-Min Ad-Dukhan in the second Rakah, and Fatihatul-Kitab and Alif Lam Mim Tanzil As-Sajdah in the third Rakah, and Fatihatul-Kitab and Tabarak Al-Mufassal in the fourth Rakah. So when you have finished with the Tasha-hud, then praise Allah and mention Allah’s greatness in an excellent manner, and send Salat upon me - and be excellent in it - and upon the rest of the Prophet. And seek forgiveness for the believing women, and for your brothers who have preceded you in faith. Then say in the end of that: “O Allah, have mercy on me by abandonment of sins forever, so long as You keep me remaining. And have mercy on me from taking upon myself what does not concern me, and provide me good sight for what will make You pleased with me. O Allah, Originator of the heavens and the earth, Possessor of glory, and generosity, and honor that is not exceeded. I ask you, O Allah, O Rahman, by Your glory and the light of Your Face, to make my heart constant in remembering Your Book as You taught me, and grant me that I recite it in the manner that will make You pleased with me. O Allah, Originator of the heavens and the earth, Possessor of glory, and generosity, and honor that is not exceeded. I ask you, O Allah, O Rahman, by Your glory and the light of Your Face, to enlighten me sight with Your Book, and make my tongue free with it, and to relieve my heart with it, and to expand my chest with it, and to wash my body with it. For indeed, none aids me upon the truth other than You, and none gives it except You, and there is no might or power except by Allah, the High, the Magnificent. (Allahummarhamni Bitarkil-Ma’asi Abadan Ma Abqaitani, Warhamni An Atakallafa Ma La Ya’nini, Warzuqni Husnan-Nazari Fi Ma Yurdika Anni. Allahumma Badi’as Samawati Wal-Ardi Dhal-Jalali Wal-Ikrami Wal-Izzatil-lat La Turamu As’aluka Ya Allahu Ya Rahmanu Bi-Jalalika Wa Nuri Wajhika An Tulzima Qalbi Hifza Kitabika Kama Allamtani Warzuqni An Atluwahu Alan-Nahwil-ladhi Yurdika Anni.

So do this three Fridays, or five, or seven, you will be answered - by the will of Allah - by the One Who sent me with the Truth, it has not failed a believer once.’”\nAbdullah bin abbas said: “So, by Allah, ali did not wait but five or seven until [Ali] came to the Messenger of Allah in a gathering similar to that and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, indeed I was [a man] in the time that passed, who used to not take except four Ayat or about that much, so when I would recite them to myself they would suddenly depart from me, and today I learn forty Ayat or about that much, and when I recite them to myself, then it is as if the Book of Allah is before my eyes. I used to hear a Hadith and when I would repeat it, it would suddenly depart from me, and today I hear Ahadith, and when I report them, I do not err in a single letter.’ So the Messenger of Allah said at that point: ‘A believer, by the Lord of the Ka’bah, O Abul-Hasan.’”</b>",
