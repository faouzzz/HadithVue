Many ahaadith are mentioned on this subject. The 'ulama give two explanations for this. The first is that because Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam preferred a simple way of life, only that much was made available as has been previously mentioned. Or that although it was available, in humbleness he did not consume it but distributed it.",
