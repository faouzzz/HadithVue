    "comments": "A question arises from this hadith, that in that last hadith of the previous chapter, it is stated that Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam always remained in deep thought and sorrow. This seems to contradict that hadith. Two explanations are given to the hadith. The first is that the meaning of the hadith is that Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam smiled more than he laughed. No other person was seen, whose smile was more than his laugh. In a further hadith which is reported from that same Sahaabi, this has been clearly elucidated. The second explanation is that Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam besides being naturally worried, smiled and appeared cheerful so that the Sahaabah radiyallahu anhum might feel at ease and comfortable. This is the pinnacle of humbleness and good character. In the fifth and sixth hadith of this chapter, Sayyidina Jarir radiyallahu anhu says that whenever Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam saw me, he met me with a cheerful smile. There now remains no contradiction with the first hadith. Many times it so happens that a person is sad and worried, but to keep others happy, or for some other reason one has the opportunity to meet them cheerfully. Those who have in their hearts a mark of love, experience this many times.",

He will be such a man who will crawl out (due to the severity of the punishment of Jahannam he will not be able to walk). He will then be ordered to enter Jannah. He will go there and find that all the places therein are occupied.

And a person that arrives first occupies as much as one pleases, there remains no place for the ones that arrive later. The elders have translated it in this manner. According to this humble servant, if the meaning of it is taken as follows, it seems more appropriate, that do you remember the vastness and plentiness of the world and how big the world was. He is being reminded, because an announcement is going to be made that a place that is ten times greater than the world shall be given to him. After imagining the vastness of the world once, it may be assessed how great this gift is?).

All your desires are fulfilled and in addition ten times the size of the world is granted to you. He will reply, \"Are you jesting with me O my Allah, and You are the King of the Kings?\" (There is no place in Jannah and You are granting me a place ten times greater than the world).

The more bounties the Ummah will receive, the more it becomes a reason for Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam to become happy.
