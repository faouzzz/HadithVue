    "hadithText": "Hazrat Zubair bin Al-Awwaam radiyallahu anhu relates that the Prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihe wasallam wore two suits of armour on his auspicious body in the Battle of Uhud (Dhaatul Fadl and Fiddah). The Prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihe wasallam intended climbing a hill but (since it was huge and due to the heavy weight of the two armours and the difficulties he confronted causing his auspicious face to bleed, as a result) he could not do so. He therefore requested Talhah radiyallahu anhu to sit and, with his aid, climbed the hill. Zubair radiyallahu anhu said, \"I heard the Prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihe wasallam say, \"It has become wajib (Jannah or the intercession of the Prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihe wasallam) for Talhah.</b>",

    "comments": "The situation of the war in the Battle of Uhud was very serious. Some people began to fear that the Prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihe wasallam had passed away. The reason for the Prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihe wasallam climbing this hill was that the Sahabah radiyallahu anhum could see him (being alive) and be reassured. Some of the learned say he climbed the hill to survey the enemy.<br><br>Hazrat Talhah radiyallahu anhu very bravely accompanied and protected the Prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihe wasallam on this day. Whenever the Sahabah radiyallahu anhum discussed the Battle of Uhud, they would say that, that day belonged to Hazrat Talhah radiyallahu anhu. Hazrat Talhah radiyallahu anhu shielded the Prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihe wasallam with his body. He received more than eighty wounds on his body and yet he did not leave the side of the Prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihe wasallam, even though his hand became paralysed.",

    "comments": "It was not against tawakkul (having complete trust in Allah) for the Prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihe wasallam to wear two armours. Firstly, according to the sufis, 'Kamaali Suluk' (The perfection of seeking) is to return to bidaayah (the beginning), that is, in general dealings to behave like the common people, and the following of the Shari'ah must become a habit. Secondly, the Prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihe wasallam did these things to teach the ummah. Thirdly, Allah Ta'ala says in the Qur'aan, \"Oh you who believe (when fighting the non-believers) protect yourselves (against their blows, etc., and also by wearing armour etc.). Then (to fight them) come out singly or collectively (as the necessity arises).\" (4; 71) Therefore in preparing arms for protection, one will be following the injunctions of the Qur'aan. And who else can obey the commands of Allah Ta'ala more than the Prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihe wasallam? By this, the use of all forms of protection is intended.",
