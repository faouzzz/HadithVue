Others say the colour of Katm is green, and when mixed with Hina it gives a black tint. Mulla Ali Qari says: 'The one that gives more colour is considered. If more Katm is used the dye becomes black and if more Hina is used, it becomes red'. The use of both colours are permissible, but black should not be used. It has been forbidden in the ahaadith to use a totally black dye.\r\n",
