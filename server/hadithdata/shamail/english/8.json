Some say it is because it covers the body well and covers it better than a lungi etc. Some say because it is 'qumait' and besides it is less of a burden on the body, whereas a sheet has to be straightened every now and then. Some are of the opinion that it does not create pride in a person, as other clothing does. According to this humble servant the reason is because it covers the satr well, and the same time it is neat, whereas in some clothing there is less beauty, like the lungi, or it does not cover the satr well, like the top sheet. The eighth hadith in this chapter seems contrary to this hadith. It shall be compared and reconciled there.",

The 'ulama have summed up the difference in several ways. Firstly, that at different times it had different lengths. Secondly, that when the sleeves were creased they were above the wrists, and when they were smooth and straight they were over the wrists. Some are of the opinion that both are taken on estimation. In this case there is no difficulty. Maulana Khalil Ahmad Saahib has written in the 'Badhlul Majhud' that where it is mentioned till the wrists, it is taken to be the best and desirable. Where the sleeves are stated to be longer, it is considered permissible. 'Allaamah Jazari states that it is sunnah that the length of the qamis (kurtah) sleeves reach till the wrists, and that of a jubbah be a bit longer, but in no case should it be longer than the fingers.",

This hadith will also be mentioned in the chapter on 'Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam leaning on something'. Imaam Tirmidhi has written a surprising incident on the sanad (chain of narrators) of this hadith, from which we can gauge the intense love of the muhadditheen for the hadith, and their detachment from this unstable and materialistic world. Muhammad bin AI-Fadl says: \"Yahya bin Mu'een (who is a great imaam and scholar of hadith - some 'ulama have said that he has written ten lakh -100,000- ahaadith with his own hands) asked me as soon as I sat down (when visiting him), about this hadith. I started reciting it to him. He said: 'I desire you to read it out from your kitaab so that it may be more satisfying\"' Muhammad bin AI-Fadl says: 'I stood up to go inside and fetch the kitaab. He caught me by my qamis and said: \"First dictate it to me from memory, so that I may write it down. There is no surety of life and death. It is possible I may meet you or Imay not meet you again. You may repeat it from the kitaab later'. Muhammad bin AI-Fadl says: 'I recited it to him from memory, then brought the kitaab and read it out again from the kitaab'. Allahu Akbar! He did not have that little assurance that either of them would live till he went inside to get a kitaab and return. His love for the hadith was such that he did not even like to wait till the kitaab was brought from inside the room.",

It could also be said that among ordinary clothing that are worn, he liked the qamis the most, and from the ones that are used for outer covering, he liked the sheet the most. It has also been stated that for purposes of evidence this is a much stronger hadith. Some 'Ulama have taken the first hadith for the different types of clothing, among which Sayyidina Rasulullah (S.A.W) liked the qamis most, and this hadith for the coloured clothing, from which he liked the coloured printed sheet the most. Some say the sheet was of a green colour. The object is that, among the colours, green was liked the most, as it is the colour of the clothing in Jannah (paradise).",

    "comments": "It is prohibited in the hadith to use clothing dyed with saffron. For this reason it has been pointed out in the above hadith that the colour of the saffron had faded, so that there remains no contradictions in the ahaadith. Sayyidina Rasulullah (S.A.W) wore the two old sheets as a sign of humility. The sufis have for this reason chosen a rugged way of life. This leads one towards humility and keeps one away from pride and arrogance. It should also be borne in mind that if (the wearing of such clothing) does not have this effect then this manner is not preferred. It will cause more harm than good as we see it happening in these times. Many a time this way is adopted to show that one has reached the stage of perfection whilst the tongue is asking (begging).<br><br>An incident of Abul-Hasan Shaa-dhali who is from among the great sufis is famous. Once he was wearing smart clothing. Some raggedly dressed person objected. He replied, \"My dressing in this manner shows praise and gratefulness to Allah, whereas this state of yours shows a state of asking (begging). You in your present state are begging from people.\" In short, it is better not to wear showy clothing but only with the intention of humbleness, and on condition that it does not lead one towards some other harm. On the other hand, if it is worn for some religious benefits or to please a confidant who has given it as a present, then in this case to wear elegant clothing will also be mandub (desirable) and better. Sayyidina Rasulullah (S.A.W) once purchased a set of clothing in exchange for twenty seven camels and wore that clothing for this reason. The mashaa-ikh of the Naqshabandiyyah and Shaa-dhaliyyah Orders usually wear elegant type of clothing. It has been given preference because it saves one from the appearance of a beggar. Imaam Abul-Hasan Shaa-dhali has said: \"It is important that one should keep away from the deceit of the heart from both angles. The gaining of fame by dressing shabbily, to show off by being humble, and to show pride by wearing smart elegant clothing, all are dangerous to our spiritual up-liftment.<br><br>There is lengthy story in this hadith that is not relevant to the dressing of Sayyidina Rasulullah (S.A.W). Therefore Imaam Tirmidhi omitted it here with the object of shortening the hadith. The story probably covers two sheets. The commentators have also omitted it for the same reason. In it are mentioned incidents of the early period and experiences of Sayyiditina Qaylah (R.A) after her acceptance of Islaam. In a few narrations it is also mentioned that Sayyidina Ralsulullah (S.A.W) was sitting with his old clothing in a humble manner. He had a branch (fan) of a palm in his mubaarak hands. A person entered his noble assembly. He saw Sayyidina Rasulullah (S.A.W) in this state of humbleness and dur to the awe-inspiring appearance of Sayyidina Rasulullah (S.A.W), began shivering. Upon seeing this person in this state, or being made aware of it, Sayyidina Rasulullah (S.A.W) said to him: \"Keep calm.\" As soon as Sayyidina Rasulullah (S.A.W) said this he became calm, and all the signs of fear vanished. In some ahaadith we gather that this incident relates to Sayyiditina Qaylah (R.A.) herself. Imaam Tirmikhi has therefore mentioned this briefly in the chapter on the sitting of Sayyidina Rasulullah (S.A.W). The incident is attributed to Sayyiditina Qaylah (R.A) and will be mentioned in the chapter on the sitting of Sayyidina Rasulullah (S.A.W).",
